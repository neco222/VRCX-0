# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in VRCX-0. Please read this before opening a pull request — it's short.

## Before you open a PR

- **UI / visual design changes are not accepted.** Restyling, re-layouts, theme tweaks, "I redesigned screen X" — please don't open these. They won't be merged.
- **Large features are rarely accepted as unsolicited PRs.** VRCX-0 follows its own roadmap. A big PR that wasn't discussed first will almost certainly be declined, no matter how much work went into it.
- **Got a genuinely good idea? Open an [issue](https://github.com/Map1en/VRCX-0/issues) first** with a detailed proposal — the problem, your approach, and the trade-offs. Get agreement before writing the code.

Small, focused fixes (clear bugs, typos, localization, obvious correctness issues) are always welcome and don't need a prior issue.

For localization work, download a DevKit build from the [package-devkit workflow](https://github.com/Map1en/VRCX-0/actions/workflows/package-devkit.yml) and use it to load local translations for review. Please also check the [localization glossary](src/localization/GLOSSARY.md) to keep domain terms consistent.

## Using AI to write your PR

Using AI is fine — no objection here. But you own what you submit:

- **Clean it up.** No leftover scaffolding, dead code, stray comments, or unrelated changes.
- **Review it yourself first.** Read every line. Understand what it does and why. Make sure it actually solves the problem.
- **Don't open one-click PRs you don't understand.** Submitting AI output you can't explain or didn't verify wastes reviewer time and is not okay.

If you can't answer "why is this change correct?", it's not ready.

## Contributor License Agreement

VRCX-0 requires contributors to sign an Individual [Contributor License
Agreement](CLA.md) before their pull requests can be merged.

The CLA does not transfer copyright ownership. You keep the copyright to your own
contributions. It grants the project maintainer broad rights to use, modify,
distribute, and relicense your contributions, including for possible closed-source
or mobile distributions.

It's a one-click process: when you open a PR, the CLA bot comments with
instructions and you sign by posting a single comment. You only need to sign
once — it applies to all of your future contributions.

If your employer may own rights to your work, or if you are contributing on behalf
of a company or organization, please contact the maintainer before signing the
individual CLA.

## Before submitting

- Make sure it builds and the checks pass — see [README](README.md) for setup.
- Keep the change minimal and on-topic.
